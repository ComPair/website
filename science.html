<!-- <h1>AMEGO: The All-sky Medium Energy Gamma-ray Observatory</h1> -->
	
<p>The three groundbreaking capabilities of AMEGO continuum sensitivity, 
nuclear line spectroscopy and polarization combine to address questions 
in the following key science areas. </p>

<h3>Understand the formation, evolution, and acceleration mechanisms in astrophysical jets</h3>

<h3>Identify the physical processes in the extreme conditions around compact objects</h3>

<h3>Measure the properties of element formation in dynamic systems</h3>
<p>The creation of "metals" in stars led to the enrichment of gas and
stars in the Galaxy to a mass fraction of about 2%. This process of
Galactic chemical evolution is driven by the star-formation rate, and
the relative rates of various sources of nucleosynthesis occurring in
dynamic environments; predominantly thermonuclear (Type Ia) and
core-collapse (Type II) SNe. </p>

<p>The chemical evolution processes are traced with spectroscopic
abundance measurements in stars and the interstellar medium, where
iron (mostly from SN Ia) and oxygen (mostly from SNII) provide a
chemical clock. Gamma-ray line astronomy contributes to this study in
unique ways: for nearby SNe it is possible to directly measure the
freshly synthesized amount of <sup>56</sup>Ni,the decay of which keeps
supernovae (SNe) bright for much longer than the adiabatic cooling of
the eject would otherwise allow. On longer time scales we find
<sup>44</sup>Ti, which deposits energy on a 100-year time scale, and
<sup>26</sup>Al and <sup>60</sup>Fe, which decay on a million-year
time scale. </p>

<p>All these unique tracers of radioactivity produced in SNe reveal their
presence via gamma-ray lines in the MeV band probed by AMEGO. The
typical yields are of order 10<sub>-4</sub> solar masses, so with an event
rate of order one per century a steady state mass of radioactive
aluminum or iron of order one solar mass is present in the disk of our
galaxy. The resulting diffuse gamma-ray line glow of these isotopes
has been detected, and in fact allows one of the best Galaxy-wide
measurements of the Galactic star-formation rate (averaged over a few
million years). </p>

<p> Gamma-ray line observations in the MeV band offer unique opportunities
to reveal the multi-source origins of the metal content of our
galaxy. It furthermore offers an opportunity to probe the central
regions of these explosive sites through the glow of supernova
remnants that occurred in the past millennium, or the detection of SNe
in the local universe. Particularly important is the potential to
detect gamma-ray lines from nearby Type Ia supernova explosions (Horiuchi
and Beacom 2010: https://arxiv.org/abs/1006.5751). <b> AMEGO will detect
$\sim$6 SN Ia per year, out to a distance of at  least 30 Mpc </b>. The
847 keV line from <sup>56</sup>Co decay directly
yields the <sup>56</sup>Ni mass, which AMEGO will measure precisely for the
nearest SNIa events. </p>

<p>This mass is a critical factor determining the SNIa light curves and
their use as standardizable candles.  Thus AMEGO will open a new
window for testing SNIa calibration as distance indicators, and hence
as probes of cosmic acceleration.  Limited sensitivity in the MeV band
prevented significant progress in this arena. With the huge boost from
AMEGO's sensitivity relative to COMPTEL and INTEGRAL, the study of the
radioactive galaxy will experience a renaissance. We expect to detect
more remnants, better map the diffuse lines (including the puzzling
511 keV line), detect explosions in nearby galaxies, and finally
detect the long-predicted nuclear lines of CNO atoms excited by
Galactic cosmic rays. AMEGO will study isotope production in ways
possible only with gamma rays, where nuclear physics reigns and atomic
sensitivities to the thermal state of the emitting plasma are
minimized. AMEGO will advance all aspects of Astronomy with
Radioactivities through its greatly boosted
sensitivity. </p>
<h3>Test models that predict dark matter signals in the MeV band</h3>

<p>The nature of dark matter is crucial to our understanding of the structure and evolution of the Universe after the big bang.  AMEGO will be the most sensitive probe  in the MeV energy range to gamma-ray signatures to two leading dark matter candidates:  Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) and axion like-particles (ALPs).  This makes it an ideal instrument for dark matter searches.</p>

<p>WIMP dark matter naturally arises in extensions of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model">Standard Model</a> of particle physics. Typically WIMPs are thought to have masses &gt1 GeV, which produce gamma rays with energies starting in the &#126;100 MeV range.  AMEGO is ideal for searching for low-mass WIMP dark matter with the necessary precision in the MeV range for detection.</p>

<center><img src="images/ALP_w_inset.png" alt="ALP absorption features"></center>

<p>ALPs interacting with photons in the presence of external magnetic fields lead to energy-dependent mixing similar to <a href="http://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.37.1237">neutrino oscillations</a>.  These oscillations yield distinctive features in the energy spectra of the target observed. Ideal targets have known large magnetic fields, such as magnetars, blazars and galaxy clusters.  Gamma rays from these sources often times traverse multiple magnetic-field  environments in which gamma rays could convert into an ALP and vice versa.  AMEGO is, with its low energy threshold, large field of view, and excellent angular resolution, the perfect instrument to search for such a signal and will extend these searches to ALP masses by orders of magnitude. The sensitivity surpasses that of current and planned dedicated ALP laboratory searches.</p>
